              <strong>Aivox is an offline-first application.</strong> We do not operate servers to store your call recordings. Your data never leaves your device unless you explicitly choose to share it through Android's system sharing intents.
           </p>
        </div>

        <h2>1. Data Collection & Storage</h2>
        <p>
           Aivox does NOT collect, store, or transmit your personal data, call audio, or contact information to any external server.
        </p>
        <ul>
           <li><strong>Audio Recordings:</strong> Stored locally in the app's private sandbox directory on your device.</li>
           <li><strong>Call Logs & Metadata:</strong> Processed locally to organize your recordings and then discarded or stored locally based on your preferences.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Permissions Usage</h2>
        <p>To function correctly, Aivox requires specific permissions. Here is how we use them:</p>
        <ul>
           <li><strong>Microphone / Audio Source:</strong> Strictly used to capture audio during active calls for recording purposes. Audio is processed in real-time on-device.</li>
           <li><strong>Storage / File Access:</strong> Required to save your recordings to your device's internal storage.</li>
           <li><strong>Phone State:</strong> Used to detect when a call starts and ends to automate recording.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
           We do not use third-party analytics SDKs (like Firebase Analytics or Google Analytics) that track user behavior. The app is completely ad-free and contains no ad networks.
        </p>
        
        <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>
           We do not share your data because we do not have access to it. Any sharing of audio files is initiated solely by you using the standard Android sharing sheet (e.g., sending a recording via email or WhatsApp).
        </p>

        <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>
           Our services are not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>
           We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes.
        </p>
